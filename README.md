# About
Python package for solving PDEs in 1D, 2D & on the sphere.

# Installation

To install, you can either download a .zip file or clone the directory with Git.

### Option 1: Download a .zip file

Download a .zip of chebpy from:

- https://github.com/Hadrien-Montanelli/chebpy/archive/main.zip

### Option 2: Clone with Git

To clone the chebpy repository, first navigate in a terminal to where you want the repository cloned, then type:
```
git clone https://github.com/Hadrien-Montanelli/chebpy.git
```
### PYTHONPATH
Once you have a copy of chebpy, you have to add it to your PYTHONPATH. If you're using an editor like Spyder, you can do this with the integrated PYTHONPATH manager. 

Otherwise, you can directly change your PYTHONPATH. For example, on a Mac, edit your `~/.bash_profile` and add:
```
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:/path_to_chebpy/"
```
Don't forget to `souce ~/.bash_profile` when you're done.
